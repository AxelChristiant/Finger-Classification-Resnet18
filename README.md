# Finger-Classification-Resnet50

Finger classification was created as a product of the deep learning course. In this repository, there are a few things to know:

1. The model is deployed to the website (using Flask) and Android (using TFLite)
2. The model uses a resnet18 architecture, where the model has preventive action from negative outcomes and can increase the depth in the created neural network.
3. The model has a training dataset of 1500 datasets with 5 classes, with 1200 training data and 300 test data.
